        <h2 class="page-title">Who actually are the Sentinelese?</h2>
        <p class="introduction-paragraph">
          All modern humans descend from Homo sapiens populations that originated in Africa roughly 
          200,000 to 300,000 years ago. The Sentinelese are believed to descend from one of the 
          earliest waves of humans who migrated out of Africa along a southern coastal route 
          approximately 60,000 to 70,000 years ago. Rather than moving inland through harsher and 
          less predictable environments, early groups likely followed coastlines, where fresh water, 
          abundant marine resources, and natural geographic pathways made gradual migration more 
          sustainable.
          <br><br>
          During this period, lower sea levels exposed large coastal plains and connected parts of 
          South and Southeast Asia, allowing movement along the rim of the Indian Ocean. Over time, 
          small groups settled in what are now the Andaman Islands. At the end of the last Ice Age, 
          rising sea levels submerged land bridges and separated connected landmasses into islands, 
          isolating certain populations from the mainland.

          <p class="second-introduction-paragraph">
            Although direct archaeological research on North Sentinel Island is not possible, 
            excavations elsewhere in the Andamans have uncovered shell middens and cave campsites 
            dating back several millennia, demonstrating deep and continuous human habitation in the 
            region. DNA studies of related Andamanese groups indicate long-term ancestral continuity, 
            suggesting that the Sentinelese represent one of the world's oldest continuous 
            communities, with lineage tracing back approximately 60,000 to 70,000 years. Their 
            continued reliance on a hunter-gatherer subsistence system reflects cultural traditions 
            rooted in the Paleolithic era, preserved through tens of thousands of years of geographic 
            isolation.

        <p class="timeline-introduction-paragraph">
          The history of the Sentinelese is marked by a series of significant events that have 
          shaped their existence and interactions with the outside world. Now that we know how 
          they came to be on North Sentinel Island, we can explore the key moments in their 
          history. Below is a chronological timeline of important events in the history of the 
          Sentinelese, from their early habitation of the island to recent interactions with 
          outsiders.

      <p class="timeline-paragraph">
        The first recorded contact between the Sentinelese and outsiders occurred in the late 19th century when British colonial expeditions attempted to establish contact. These encounters were often hostile, with the Sentinelese defending their territory aggressively. The British efforts to contact the tribe were largely unsuccessful and resulted in increased hostility from the Sentinelese, reinforcing their desire for isolation.

        <p class="timeline-paragraph">
          The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami devastated many coastal communities, but the Sentinelese survived, likely due to their deep knowledge of the island and its warning signs. Their resilience highlighted their adaptability and the effectiveness of their isolation.

          In 2018, American missionary John Allen Chau was killed by the Sentinelese after illegally attempting to contact and convert them. The event sparked global debate about the ethics of contacting isolated tribes and reinforced the need for strict protection.

          Today, the Indian government enforces strict laws to protect the Sentinelese, prohibiting outsiders from approaching the island. These policies aim to preserve their isolation and safeguard their health and culture.
