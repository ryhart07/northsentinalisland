        <p class="introduction-paragraph">
          The North Sentinelese are an extremely isolated tribe who inhabit 
          North Sentinel Island in the Bay of Bengal, a region belonging to India. They 
          are widely regarded as one of the last uncontacted peoples in the world and 
          are believed to have lived on the island in isolation for around 60,000 years.
          <br><br>
          Over time, the tribe has become known for its strong resistance to outside contact, 
          with numerous recorded incidents involving hostility toward approaching outsiders. 
          Although brief periods of friendly contact were reported in the early 1990s, these 
          encounters were limited and did not lead to any lasting interaction.

        <img class="subsection-img" src="images/north-sentine-island-side-view.webp" alt="North Sentinel Island Side View">
        <p class="subsection-paragraph">
          This isolation is not accidental but a deliberate choice made by the North Sentinelese 
          themselves. The tribe has consistently demonstrated that it does not wish to engage with 
          the outside world, often reacting aggressively to attempted contact. In recognition of this, 
          the Indian government has declared the island off-limits and made it illegal to approach 
          within a restricted distance. 
          <br><br>
          These legal protections are intended to respect the tribe's 
          autonomy while also preserving their traditional way of life, which has remained largely 
          unchanged for thousands of years.
